# Richonguzman / CA2RXU LoRa APRS iGate/Digirepeater

This firmware is for using ESP32 based boards with LoRa Modules and GPS to live in the APRS world.

__(NOTE: This iGate Firmware was develop to work with all LoRa APRS Trackers and specially with this firmware <a href="https://github.com/richonguzman/LoRa_APRS_Tracker" target="_blank">LoRa APRS Tracker</a>)__

This next generation LoRa iGate can work as:
- pure RX-iGate, 
- Rx+Tx-iGate and distribute messages and weather forecasts to heard trackers, and 
- Digipeater in simplex or split-frequency environment.

In all configurations the display shows the current stationMode, heard packets and events the iGate is currently performing.

But under the hood is much more:

- Web Configuration UI.
- Sending events to remote syslog server.
- OTA update capability (for Firmware and Filesystem).
- RX first, TX will only be done if there is no traffic on the frequency.
- automatic update of the Lora symbol at APRS-IS, black "L" for pure RX, red "L" for TX capability, green star "L" for digipeater and blue round "L" for WX iGate.
- support for multiple WLAN with corresponding coordinates.
- support for BME/BMP280 and BME680 sensors, sending to WX data to APRS-IS.

and more will come:
- More Web UI Station Information
